* The challenge description probably gave away what form you should attack.
* If you happen to know the email address of the admin already, you can launch a targeted attack.
* You might be lucky with a dedicated attack pattern even if you have no clue about the admin email address.
* If you harvested the admin’s password hash, you can of course try to attack that instead of using SQL Injection.
* Alternatively you can solve this challenge as a combo with the Log in with the administrator’s user credentials without previously changing them or applying SQL Injection challenge.
