* The API call is part of a scheduled process "behind the scenes", i.e. completely unrelated to the web application.
* Check the Juice Shop’s social media channels for regularly scheduled content being posted, possibly even indicating that it was automatically created.
* Find out which part of the content might come from the response of an API call.
* Find the place where the API call happens — as stated above, it is not in the web application — and then look for the API key itself.
