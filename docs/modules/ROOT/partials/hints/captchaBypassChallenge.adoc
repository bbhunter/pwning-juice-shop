* After finding a CAPTCHA bypass, write a script that automates feedback submission. Or open many browser tabs and be really quick.
* You could prepare 10 browser tabs, solving every CAPTCHA and filling out the each feedback form. Then you’d need to very quickly switch through the tabs and submit the forms in under 20 seconds total.
* Should the Juice Shop ever decide to change the challenge into "Submit 100 or more customer feedbacks within 60 seconds" or worse, you’d probably have a hard time keeping up with any tab-switching approach.
* Investigate closely how the CAPTCHA mechanism works and try to find either a bypass or some automated way of solving it dynamically.
* Wrap this into a script (in whatever programming language you prefer) that repeats this 10 times.
