* This challenge exploits a weird option that is supported when signing tokens with JWT.
* You should begin with retrieving a valid JWT from the applicationâ€™s Authorization request header.
* A JWT is only given to users who have logged in. They have a limited validity, so better do not dawdle.
* Try to convince the site to give you a valid token with the required payload while downgrading to no encryption at all.
* Make sure your JWT is URL safe!
