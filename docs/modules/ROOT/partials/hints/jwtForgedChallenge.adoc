* This challenge is explicitly not about acquiring the RSA private key used for JWT signing.
* The three generic hints from Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token also help with this challenge.
* Instead of enforcing no encryption to be applied, try to apply a more sophisticated exploit against the JWT libraries used in the Juice Shop.
* Getting your hands on the public RSA key the application employs for its JWTs is mandatory for this challenge.
* Finding the corresponding private key should actually be impossible, but that obviously doesnâ€™t make this challenge unsolvable.
* Make sure your JWT is URL safe!
